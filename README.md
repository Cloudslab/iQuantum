# iQuantum: A Toolkit for Modeling and Simulation of Quantum Computing Environments

As quantum computers become increasingly accessible through 
cloud services and potentially edge networks, the demand for efficient resource 
management strategies and service models has grown. 
iQuantum is a pioneering simulation toolkit (based on CloudSim 6) designed to model quantum computing
environments, enabling researchers to prototype and evaluate system design and
scheduling algorithms. iQuantum addresses the challenges posed by the limited 
availability and accessibility of quantum resources, catalyzing research in 
quantum software and systems.

## Main Features
The iQuantum project aims to boost research in quantum software and systems,
particularly focusing on resource management, job scheduling, qubit mapping, and
task orchestration in quantum computing environments that
integrate cloud-based resources.
- Modeling quantum computing environments with cloud-based resources: Quantum Datacenters (QDatacenter), 
Quantum Computers (QNode), Quantum Tasks (Qulet), and Quantum Broker (QBroker).
- Modeling qulet scheduling algorithms for quantum computing environments.
- Modeling qubit mapping algorithms for quantum computing environments.

## Installation
The downloaded package contains all the source code and examples for iQuantum.
The installation and execution process is similar to CloudSim 6.0. 

## Examples
The package contains several examples that demonstrate the use of iQuantum.
The examples are located in the `org.iquantum.examples` package.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. 
For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
