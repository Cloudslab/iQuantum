##  A Toolkit for Modeling and Simulation of Quantum Computing Environments

As quantum computers become increasingly accessible through 
cloud services and potentially edge networks, the demand for efficient resource 
management strategies and service models has grown. 
iQuantum is a pioneering simulation toolkit (based on CloudSim) designed to model hybrid quantum-classical
computing environments, enabling researchers to prototype and evaluate system design and
resource management algorithms. iQuantum addresses the challenges posed by the limited 
availability and accessibility of quantum resources, catalyzing research in 
quantum software and systems.

## Main Features
The iQuantum project aims to boost research in quantum software and systems,
particularly focusing on resource management, job scheduling, qubit mapping, and
task orchestration in quantum computing environments that
integrate cloud-based resources.
- Modeling quantum computing environments with cloud-based resources: Quantum Datacenters (QDatacenter), 
Quantum Computers (QNode), QPU, Quantum Tasks (QTask), and Quantum Broker (QBroker).
- Modeling QTask scheduling algorithms for quantum computing environments.
- Modeling qubit mapping algorithms for quantum computing environments.
- Modeling Hybrid Quantum-Classical Task Orchestration in the Cloud-Edge Continuum.


## Installation and Examples
The downloaded package contains all the source code and examples for iQuantum.
Several examples that demonstrate the use of iQuantum can be found in the `org.iquantum.examples` package, located in `/modules/iquantum-examples` folder.
iQuantum API documentation can be found at https://cloudslab.github.io/iQuantum/.
Please note that iQuantum is still under development for adding advanced features and the API documentation is not fully complete yet. 
More details will be updated soon.
