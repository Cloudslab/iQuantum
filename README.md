# iQuantum 
## A Toolkit for Modeling and Simulation of Quantum Computing Environments

As quantum computers become increasingly accessible through 
cloud services and potentially edge networks, the demand for efficient resource 
management strategies and service models has grown. 
iQuantum is a pioneering simulation toolkit (based on CloudSim 6) designed to model quantum computing
environments, enabling researchers to prototype and evaluate system design and
scheduling algorithms. iQuantum addresses the challenges posed by the limited 
availability and accessibility of quantum resources, catalyzing research in 
quantum software and systems.

iQuantum offers a wide array of potential use cases and extensions, including:

- **Quantum Job Scheduling Algorithms**: 
By generating cloud workloads, iQuantum enables users to design and evaluate 
adaptable job scheduling algorithms for quantum cloud environments. 
This simulation capability allows researchers to investigate various 
quantum computing scenarios and assess the effectiveness of different 
scheduling strategies, ultimately enhancing system performance and efficiency.

- **Qubit Mapping Algorithms**: Qubit mapping ensures the compatibility of quantum 
circuits with the target quantum computer. iQuantum facilitates the design and 
evaluation of qubit mapping strategies, which optimize the utilization of 
quantum cloud resources and enable concurrent processing of multiple 
quantum circuits in today's noisy quantum systems.

The iQuantum project aims to boost research in quantum software and systems, 
particularly focusing on resource management, job scheduling, and hybrid 
quantum-classical task orchestration in quantum computing environments that 
integrate edge and cloud resources.

## Installation
The downloaded package contains all the source code and examples for iQuantum.
The installation and execution process is similar to CloudSim 6.0. 
More details will be updated soon.
